I'm going on an adventure! Start with GitHub
Hi! My name is Rafael, I'm from Brazil but currently living in Uruguay, lovely place. After my graduation I've been trying to learn something new. I consider myself a good person and maybe too honest, which is hard to believe, but I'm okay with that. So, hello to you, have a good day, take care and thanks for all the fish.
